# 🧭 Project Updates History  
_Chronicle of key architectural decisions, identity changes, and cross-branch evolutions._

## 📌 [2025-07-14] – Branch `main`

### 🔁 Project Identity Update  
**Previous name:** Postman P4.1 Horizon  
**New name:** Postman 4:Horizon (Up.1)

This global rename reflects a strategic shift in the structure and branding logic of the project. While `P4` continues to represent the stable core framework, the introduction of `"Horizon"` signals a new design phase with refined UI, expanded components, and version-aware styling.

The suffix `Up.1` (Update 1) introduces a modular approach to versioning:
- Future iterations may be named `Up.2`, `Up.3`, etc.
- Each update reflects a visual, functional, or architectural milestone.

### 📚 Documentation Alignment  
All documentation files, navigation elements, and internal references have been updated to reflect the new identity format. This ensures consistency across development, publishing, and branding layers.

> _This naming pattern sets a precedent for scalable updates in the Horizon ecosystem — allowing each major iteration to preserve the P4 lineage while adding identity and clarity._
